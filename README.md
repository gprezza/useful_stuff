# useful_stuff
Random scripts/config files that do useful things and that took me way too long to make

## [interactive_volcano_plot.R](https://github.com/gprezza/useful_stuff/blob/main/interactive_volcano_plot.R)
R script to do "interactive" volcano plots with plotly. Among other things, saves the plot as an html file with search (search a gene and highlight it in the plot) and external link (click on any dot of the plot opens a new tab to a pre-defined link (e.g. with info on the gene)) functions.

## [.tmux.conf](https://github.com/gprezza/useful_stuff/blob/main/.tmux.conf)
Config file for tmux
